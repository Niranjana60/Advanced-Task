Project Mars is an online trading platform for skills. Users can trade their skills and guests can search for skills to exchange. 
This platform provides the toolset to manage appointments as well as a smart rating and feedback mechanism to give insight to new users.
We used docker to test the development version of the app and it's a white-label skill trading marketplace platform.
